# Tic Tac Toe with AI (Reinforcement Learning)

This is a Tic Tac Toe game project developed in Python, featuring a web-based graphical interface using Flask. The game includes an AI opponent powered by reinforcement learning that learns and improves over time.

## 🎮 Features
- Interactive game: Human vs AI
- AI that learns and improves as it plays
- User-friendly web interface (HTML)
- Pre-trained model with continuous learning support

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Install Flask if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
3. Run the main server file:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- Reinforcement Learning

## 📂 Main Files
- `server.py` – Main server file
- `index.html` – User interface (located in the `templates` folder)
- `ai_model.pkl` – Pre-trained AI model (if applicable)

## 🙋‍♂️ About the Project
This project was developed by Reuven Rubin as a way to combine machine learning with interactive web applications. It demonstrates the use of reinforcement learning models in a simple, engaging game environment.

> Play, try to beat the AI, and watch it get smarter 😄
